set up timer
set up interrupt

process:

buggy runs into wall ==> clear goes down ==> action happens ==> begin timer as soon as rover starts moving ==> stop timer when clear goes dark again

therefore, clear interrupt on falling edge (when clear < AILT) oki

do we need something to do about timer interrupts? surely not
